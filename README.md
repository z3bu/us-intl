# us-intl
Keymap files for the US intl with dead keys and English intl with dead keys
Never found the US international xkb equivalent for tty - so here you go

AltGr access the dead keys on the altgrintl version.
On the classic US intl the dead keys are direct, altgr allows to access the normal characters.

The keymap is defined using the keysyms you can find here http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/List_of_keysyms

I personally prefere the intl altgr version.

Added the symbol plusminus on the "-" key
