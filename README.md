# us-intl
Keymap files for the US intl with dead keys and English intl with dead keys
Never found the US international xkb equivalent for tty - so here you go

AltGr access the dead keys on the altgrintl version.
On the classic US intl the dead keys are direct, altgr allows to access the normal characters.

The keymap is defined using the keysyms you can find here http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/List_of_keysyms
You can input char unicodes directly with a keypad and AltGr.

Caps lock works on letters as usual.

Added the symbol plusminus on the "-" key
Missing some dead keysym to be implemented

You should use the GNU unifont http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html for better support of unicode on your console.

Try to use kmscon for a direct xkb support.
